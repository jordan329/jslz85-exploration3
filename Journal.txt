Last week we explored Materialize css
this week we will continue exploring Material Design as a front end design specification, by exploring react-materialize,
a library of components made to bring materialize css to react development

we'll start with out old project which uses create-react-app and is hosted on firebase.
then we install react-materialize with npm
"npm install react-materialize"
and make sure our index.html file includes some links in the head and scripts in the body.

HEAD 
    Import Google Icon Font
        href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet"
    Import materialize.css
        href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/0.98.0/css/materialize.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
BODY  
    Import jQuery before materialize.js
        src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"
        src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/0.98.0/js/materialize.min.js"
    And then your bundled js
        src="path/to/your/bundle.js"

and delete old references that may conflict with this version of materializecss

We are going to replace all of the classname="[materialize classes specified here]" to react-materialize components.

Starting with the <nav> tag replace that in "home.js" with <Navbar> and <NavItem> making sure first to use that the top of "home.js" an import statment for the new components
    import {Navbar, NavItem} from "react-materialize"

Now lets change all div's with classname row and change them to <Row> making sure to add Row to the import at the top

then do the same with col to <Col>
make sure to get rid of the the classnames on the new Col elements and instead use the props m="4" s="12" to use the grid sizing for each column to be evenly spaced

then replace the entire div with card class to the following 
<Card
    header={<CardTitle image='https://i.imgur.com/kUCMPWX.jpg'>Here are some Dogs</CardTitle>}
    actions={[<a href="#e">This can be a link to a page with more information</a>]}>
        Simple cards. are good at containing small bits of
        information. this is convenient because it requires little
        markup to use.
</Card>

this is much less markup, the image, link and title are all specified as props to the component and react-materialize does the rest for us

Now continuing to the inputs if you replace the outermost row containing them with this
<Row s='12'>
    <Input s="12" m='6' label="First Name" >
        <Icon>account_circle</Icon>
    </Input>
    <Input s="12" m='6' label="Phone Number" >
        <Icon class="material-icons prefix">phone</Icon>
    </Input>
</Row>

you can see that all of the formatting is done with props s and m
 implementing the 12 column grid easily with very little markup

 This change from materializecss to react-materialize has made our home.js file go from just over 100 lines of code to just under 60 lines.
 that makes it much quicker to read and understand allowing us to focus on functionality more and looks less when prototyping.
